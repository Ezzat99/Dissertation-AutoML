"AutoML: A Comparison of Available Platforms with Example Applications" By Amr Ezzat

In recent years, AutoML has become a trending topic in industry because it is linked with producing machine learning solutions without the intervention of 
data scientists.
This new stride in technology opens up a lot of opportunity if it does what it promises, especially for those without the theoretical background currently 
needed for a role in data science. This dissertation sets out to find out the effectiveness of AutoML today. I perform an up-to-date comparison between some 
of the best available AutoML platforms and share my insights. This will allow us to know if machine learning is as trustworthy and reliable without the 
intervention of substantial human resources to determine a good machine learning pipeline.
